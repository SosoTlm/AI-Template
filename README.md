# AI Coding and API Helper

This project provides an **AI-powered API** to assist developers with coding-related queries, generating relevant code snippets, and providing explanations for programming concepts or API usage. Built using **FastAPI** and **Hugging Face's Transformers**, the API leverages language models like GPT to deliver accurate and helpful responses to technical questions.

## Features

- **Text-based AI Assistant**: Handles programming and API-related queries, such as "How to send a POST request in Python?" or "What is a class in OOP?".
- **Code Generation**: Provides relevant code snippets based on user prompts.
- **API-First Design**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for easy integration.
- **Extensible and Scalable**: Built on top of FastAPI and can be deployed easily to any cloud platform.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server for running FastAPI apps.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: A library that provides access to state-of-the-art NLP models such as GPT, BERT, and more.
- **PyTorch**: Used as the deep learning framework for running the AI models.
